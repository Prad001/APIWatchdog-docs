ApiWatchdog helps you **discover, analyze, document, and secure APIs** by processing logs, collections, and runtime data.  
It leverages AI to streamline API governance and reduce manual effort in specification writing, flow mapping, and security analysis.

---

## Key Features

- **Discover Endpoints** — Automatically detect and catalog API endpoints from uploaded files.  
- **Generate Specs** — Use AI to transform observed endpoints and payloads into OpenAPI/Swagger specifications.  
- **Visualize Flows** — Render request/response activity into interactive sequence diagrams.  
- **Security Analysis** — Identify risks, group findings by severity, and provide remediation steps.  
- **Full Report** — Generate consolidated documentation packages (specs, diagrams, findings, PDFs).

## Typical Workflow

1. **Upload Files**  
   Provide logs, HAR files, Postman collections, or other sources of API activity.

2. **Discover Endpoints**  
   ApiWatchdog scans and catalogs endpoints with usage patterns and sample payloads.

3. **Generate API Specs**  
   Automatically create OpenAPI/Swagger specifications with request/response examples and coverage metrics.

4. **Visualize Flows**  
   Map out key user journeys or system flows with interactive diagrams.

5. **Run Security Analysis**  
   Detect authentication, authorization, and input validation gaps, with actionable recommendations.

6. **Generate Full Report**  
   Package everything — specs, diagrams, and security findings — into exportable artifacts for teams.

## Supported File Types

- **Postman collections**  
- **HAR files** (browser network traces)  
- **Server/application logs**  
- **Sample payloads** (request/response bodies, configs)  

---

## Exports & Integrations

- **OpenAPI Specs** — YAML or other formats for use with Swagger, Postman, or API Gateways.  
- **Sequence Diagrams** — PNG/SVG/Mermaid scripts for documentation and reviews.  
- **Security Reports** — PDF format for triage, compliance, and audits.  
- **Full Documentation** — PDF/Markdown packages for stakeholders.  

---

## Best Practices

- Upload data from **multiple environments** (dev, staging, prod) for broad coverage.  
- Include both **success and error responses** to enrich specifications.  
- Prioritize **high severity security findings** for remediation.  
- Use **versioned exports** to maintain traceability and audit history.

## Next Steps

- Start by uploading files in the **Upload** section.  
- Explore discovered endpoints in **Discover Endpoints**.  
- Generate and validate your spec in **Generate Specs**.  
- Visualize workflows in **Visualize Flows**.  
- Review risks in **Security Analysis**.  
- Package everything into a **Full Report** for sharing with your team.
