title: Discover Endpoints
description: Discover and catalog all API endpoints from your files
---
The **Discover Endpoints** tab in ApiWatchdog provides a comprehensive view of all API endpoints detected from your uploaded files. This feature helps teams **catalog, analyze, and track usage patterns** of APIs across different environments.

---

- Automatically discovers API endpoints from uploaded files.
- Provides statistics on **total endpoints**, **health status**, **warnings**, and **issues**.
- Supports filtering by HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, etc.).
- Displays **sample requests and responses** when available.
- Highlights **usage frequency** to prioritize critical endpoints.

---

## Dashboard Metrics

The top-level summary cards provide at-a-glance insight:

- **Total Endpoints** — Number of unique API endpoints discovered.  
- **Healthy** — Endpoints that returned expected status codes and behaved as intended.  
- **Warnings** — Endpoints that returned unexpected responses or edge cases (e.g., 400/404 expected but unusual).  
- **Issues** — Endpoints with critical failures or errors requiring investigation.

---

## Filtering

Endpoints can be filtered by **HTTP Method** for easier navigation:

- `GET`
- `POST`
- `PUT`
- `PATCH`
- `DELETE`
- `All` (default view)

This allows you to quickly drill down into the subset of endpoints relevant to your task.

---

## Endpoints Table

Each discovered endpoint is listed with the following details:

| Column      | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Method**  | HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, etc.), color-coded for quick identification. |
| **Path**    | The API path (e.g., `/api/users/{id}`). |
| **Status**  | Endpoint health indicator (Healthy, Warning, or Issue). |
| **Description** | Short explanation of the endpoint’s purpose or behavior. |
| **Usage**   | Number of times the endpoint was observed in uploaded files. |

---

## Sample Requests & Responses

For each endpoint, ApiWatchdog can display:

- **Sample Request** — Example request payload, query parameters, or headers.  
- **Sample Response** — Example response body and status code.  

These examples are extracted directly from the uploaded files (logs, responses, etc.) and provide real-world usage context.

---

## Supported File Types

ApiWatchdog can discover endpoints from multiple sources:

- **JSON** — API responses, configuration files  
- **HAR** —  JSON-formatted log of a web browser's network interactions with a website  
- **LOG** — Server logs, access logs  

---

## How to Use

1. Upload API-related files in the **Upload** section (drag & drop supported).  
2. ApiWatchdog automatically analyzes and discovers endpoints.  
3. Navigate to **Discover Endpoints** to review the results.  
4. Use filters to explore endpoints by method or status.  
5. Expand endpoints to view sample request/response examples.  

---

## Best Practices

- Upload files from **multiple environments** (dev, staging, production) for broader coverage.  
- Include both **success and error responses** to capture edge cases.  
- Regularly review **warnings and issues** to maintain API health.  
- Share exported endpoint reports with your **development and security teams**.

## Example Endpoint Entry (Generalized)

```json
{
  "method": "POST",
  "path": "/api/users",
  "status": "healthy",
  "description": "Create a new user",
  "usage": 42,
  "sampleRequest": {
    "body": { "name": "John Doe", "role": "Admin" }
  },
  "sampleResponse": {
    "status": 201,
    "body": { "id": 123, "name": "John Doe", "role": "Admin" }
  }
}
```

---

## Next Steps

- Export discovered endpoints as **OpenAPI specifications**.  
- Analyze **flows and dependencies** between endpoints.  
- Review **security findings and recommendations** generated by ApiWatchdog.  
- Generate and share **comprehensive reports** with your team.
